This probably only makes sense as part of a larger playbook that installs a leihs instance, like used in [that playbook](https://github.com/psy-q/leihs-setup-ansible).

Make sure to have the SSH public keys of all users you want to access the leihs instance as leihs user in your files/ssh_keys directory, relative to the playbook directory.
